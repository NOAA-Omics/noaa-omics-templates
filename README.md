## How to use this site

### Experienced users

If you are an experienced user looking for a quick start guide to managing your data and metadata, we suggest starting with the section [Getting Started](https://test-dmg-mkdocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started.html), [Data Management Plan Template](https://test-dmg-mkdocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dmp-template.html), and then [Study Data Templates](https://test-dmg-mkdocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/study-data-templates.html) to work with your own data.

### New users

If you are new to creating data management plans, or want more background on best practices in 'omics data management, each of the sections will be useful. We suggest starting with [Getting Started](https://test-dmg-mkdocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started.html),  getting more detail from sections [Metadata Guidelines](https://test-dmg-mkdocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/metadata-guidelines.html) and [Omics Data Guidelines](https://test-dmg-mkdocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/omics-data-guidelines.html), then build your [Data Management plan with the template](https://test-dmg-mkdocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dmp-template.html). To work with your own data, look to [Study Data Templates](https://test-dmg-mkdocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/study-data-templates.html). 

## Overview

Management of data generated in research is critical to ensure fidelity of the scientific enterprise and maximum utility of research funding. Management of omics data presents additional challenges because of its large datasets, new and diverse technologies generating those datasets, and the many types of data and environmental data involved.

The motivation of this guide is to facilitate finding the data produced by every NOAA omics project and ensuring that they are usable by future researchers.

The focus of this guide is to help omics users decide which data goes to which repositories (NCEI, NCBI, etc.), and how to deposit their data so that it will be FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable), including following community standards for raw data, processed data, and contextual metadata and environmental data.
