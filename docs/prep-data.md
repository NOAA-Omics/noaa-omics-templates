# prep_data sheets  

Contextual data about how the samples were prepared for sequencing. Includes how they were extracted, what molecular protocols were used, how they were sequenced. Two prep_data sheets are provided: one for amplicon preps (amplicon_prep_data) and one for metagenomic preps (metag_prep_data). All of terms in the metag_prep_data sheet are also in the amplicon_prep_data sheet. The 1st section of these sheets is in the format for an NCBI SRA upload and should NOT be rearranged or renamed. Each row is a separate sequencing library preparation, distinguished by a unique library_id. One sample from sample_prep could be represented multiple times on these sheets if multiple marker genes were amplified or multiple replicate sequencing libraries were prepared.
