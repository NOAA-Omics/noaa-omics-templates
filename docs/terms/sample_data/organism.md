# Term: organism

*Often "seawater metagenome" or "sediment metagenome". Use "synthetic metagenome" for mock communities. The most descriptive organism name for this sample (to the species, if possible). It is OK to submit an organism name that is not in our database. In the case of a new species, provide the desired organism name, and our taxonomists may assign a provisional taxID. In the case of unidentified species, choose the appropriate Genus and include 'sp.', e.g., "Escherichia sp.". When sequencing a genome from a non-metagenomic source, include a strain or isolate name too, e.g., "Pseudomonas sp. UK4". For environmental or microbiome samples, use the [metagenomes taxonomy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?id=408169). More information about providing a valid organism, including new species, metagenomes (microbiomes) and metagenome-assembled genomes, see [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/docs/organism/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/docs/organism/).*
