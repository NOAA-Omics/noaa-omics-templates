# sample_data sheet. 

Contextual data about the samples collected, such as when it was collected, where it was collected from, what kind of sample it is, and what were the properties of the environment or experimental condition from which the sample was taken. Each row is a distinct sample. Most of this information is recorded during sample collection. Many terms have controlled vocabulary, such as organism, env_broad_scale, waterBody. This file contains information that is submitted to NCBI when generating a BioSample. Other important fields for metadata processing include amplicon_sequenced, which helps to link together different types of metdata. This sheet contains terms from the MIMARKS survey water 6.0 package. For other types of samples (eg, sediment), use the appropriate AOML_MIMARKS.survey.sediment file.

| [organism](https://noaa-omics-templates.readthedocs.io/en/latest/terms/sample_data/organism.html) | Often "seawater metagenome" or "sediment metagenome".

In the case of unidentified species, choose the appropriate Genus and include 'sp.', e.g., "Escherichia sp.". When sequencing a genome from a non-metagenomic source, include a strain or isolate name too, e.g., "Pseudomonas sp. UK4". For environmental or microbiome samples, used the metagenomes taxonomy (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Undef&id=408169).
